While we each have specific angles of interest when looking at the project, there is a shared curiosity about the underlying patterns that contribute to the popularity of music. Despite the wide variety of tastes in society, there are likely trends that explain what factors permeate the most listened to and celebrated songs. Our goal then, is to determine what some of these elements could be and their relative influence. Some of the broader questions that could inspire more specific research include: 1. Which distinct elements are most valuable in popular music?  2. Is there a combination of elements that is present in the most popular music? 3. Are these same factors missing in the least popular music? This last question particularly aims to tackle the possible assumption in the previous two, that only musical elements are relevant to the success of music. If for example, we discover that the least popular music has similar characteristics to the most popular music, then perhaps we could suggest that more social factors or even the identity of artists are (to a degree) more important than the features of the music itself. I could imagine an interesting spotify music themed dashboard, that uses this dataset to reveal to the public what features of music they most value.
