# Project Vision

The purpose of this project is to strive towards a nuanced understanding of what factors make music popular. In this exploration there are a few principles that will help us ensure that we arrive at a robust and useful conclusion. Firstly we will need to maintain objectivity when analyzing the statistics within the data set. This means suspending our opinions about which factors we may personally believe to be more influential. Doing so would be especially important in situations where multiple factors display similar patterns. The second key principle is critical thinking. Beyond just presenting observations like correlation, we will seek to go further and find tests to prove whether relationships are causational as well. Lastly, this project will involve holistic consideration. Rather than just looking at individual factors, we will also consider the interaction of different elements and the implications for our research question. As the project progresses towards conclusion, we hope to find a variety of ways to manipulate our data set in order to reach meaningful findings.
